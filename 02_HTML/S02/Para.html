  The Source Control icon in the Activity Bar on the left will always indicate
  an overview of how many changes you currently have in your repository.
  Selecting the icon will show you the details of your current repository
  changes: CHANGES, STAGED CHANGES and MERGE CHANGES.

  You can also find indicators of the status of your repository in the
  bottom-left corner of VS Code: the current branch, dirty indicators, and the
  number of incoming and outgoing commits of the current branch. You can
  checkout any branch in your repository by clicking that status indicator and
  selecting the Git reference from the list.
